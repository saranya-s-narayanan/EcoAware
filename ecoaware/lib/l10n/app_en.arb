While efforts have been made to ensure accuracy, these values may not be 100% accurate due to the dynamic nature of environmental factors. However, they will provide users with a general idea of their carbon footprint and encourage them to adopt sustainable habits.\n\nWe hope this app contributes to raising awareness about sustainable living and inspires positive changes in our everyday choices to protect the environment for future generations.\n",
